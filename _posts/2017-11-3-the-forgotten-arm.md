Does that look like a typical moment in your day? Too much to do, not enough resources to do it, and a mandate to get it done. You have to prioritize, some things get left for another time, and, ultimately, you are left to explain your decisions to the people who wanted those other things done.

We have made great strides in quantifying things over the last two decades, most notably with the application of graph theory, which is \(basically\) just a bunch of math applied to structures that look like the one up at the top of the page. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn use it to build a social graph with an increasingly uncanny degree of predictive accuracy. Amazon uses it to recommend products to hundreds of millions of users every day. As we explored in our last article, our tools and technology resemble graph structures more and more. Graphs have the ability to model everything, from simple two dimensional interactions like people-to-people connection, or highly complex, multi-dimensional interactions like those found in advanced analytical models. When we talk about the latter, we have to consider the scale required to process those graphs on our computational hardware. It's not an easy problem: it requires distribution, orchestration and coordination to process massive structures across multiple nodes. But, even these scaling problems are nothing when compared to the Big Graph - a structure that describes every interaction, of every thing, at every moment, past, present and future, in the entire world.

The Big Graph is, at this moment, only a theory. We have neither the resources, nor the will, to attempt a project of such scale. We can, however, begin to understand *why* such a project will ultimately be necessary as the world pushes for higher scale and more efficiency. Quantifying interactions in the Big Graph has applications in every aspect of our lives, but perhaps the most important benefit is the ability to trace the root cause of failures. We have taken to calling these interaction chains cascades.

A tangible example comes from the logistics industry. Typically thought of as supply chain risk, a cascade in component availability can cause cost increases and delays, passed to the end consumer as unexpected pricing and inconsistent availability. A less trivial example is the levee system in New Orleans, which was built with a minimal margin for error that Hurricane Katrina quickly eclipsed. The resulting cascade was deadly and is still bearing out its effects today. New York City's MTA, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor are in the midst of a cascade now, as decades of deferred maintenance on tracks, tunnels and bridges will force the agencies to either suspend operations to rebuild critical infrastructure or continue to serve customers with significant impact.

In truth, we live amidst innumerable cascades, not all of which have negative effects. Independent of political commentary, the conservative economic view of tax cuts is a popular example of a positive cascade, in which higher net income leads to additional investment in the economy. Cascading thinking can be an effective tool in both mitigating failure and designing long-term solutions. The insights discovered by this line of inquiry vary quite greatly, but there are two main constants. The first affects cost-benefit analysis, in that it is nearly always less expensive to fix a problem now than it is to fix it later \(see the New Orleans and New York examples above\). The second is, in the words of the authors James S.A. Corey, "forgotten arm" - the thing you don't see coming. The interaction chains that result in cascades are fragile systems by definition, and unexpected interaction \(the forgotten arm\) typically ends in the collapse of that chain - often in the form of death and destruction.

Stay tuned over the next month as we explore two core cascades in more detail.
