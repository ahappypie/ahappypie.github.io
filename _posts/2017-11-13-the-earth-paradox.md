Go outside.

Seriously, this will still be here, and I promise going outside will prove a point later. Go!

We've been discussing cascades, those dangerous \(or helpful!\) interaction chains in the world's Big Graph. Today we'll look at a deeply ingrained cascade - evolution.

Evolution is, of course, a textbook case for the graph data structure. There are innumerable interactions between the world and our DNA \(many of which we don't understand\) that produce each strand. It may not even be possible to quantify the entirety of those interactions, but if we observe from a slightly higher level, we discover one of the most trivial, and most difficult, problems of all time.

So you went outside, maybe it was a perfect 72 and sunny, maybe you had to bundle up. Either way, when you went outside, there was one constant. You could breathe. Told you it would be trivial. Yes, big surprise, you walked outside on the planet Earth and could inhale and exhale without suffering an immediate and horrible fate. There are other nice things about going outside on Earth as well - you don't get blasted by lethal solar radiation, and even if you did have to deal with hot or cold temperatures, you were a champ and pulled it off.

Seeing as we grew up on a similar planet, it's not surprising that humans do well in places that have a predictable temperature range between 0 and 120 degrees fahrenheit, with surface gravity around 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>, a well composed atmosphere \(80/20 nitrogen/oxygen mix\) with an ozone layer that mediates nasty radiation and strong magnetic fields that defend against solar winds. These are the major environmental interactions in our species evolution. We evolved to take advantage of the conditions this one planet has in abundance.

However, it's a paradox. It's a positive cascade in that we most definitely wouldn't be here without it, but it's a negative cascade in that it's more than physical evolution. When I told you to go outside, what was the process you went through? Chances are you made sure you had the right clothes for the weather and went for it. Point is, for humans on planet Earth, going outside is easy. If the building you are in right now were to light on fire, you'd go outside because it's safer, it's a trivial solution to the otherwise difficult problem of surviving a fire.

This triviality is genetic. Now, I'm not a geneticist, and I haven't discovered a gene which proves that claim, but that's because it's not physically genetic, it's culturally genetic. Over the history of the human race, the ultimate solution to any problem was to literally walk away. And you could! Until very recently, there were places to go where you could start your own kingdom, and run it just how you wanted. When that became impossible, we resorted to forcibly carving out territory via conflict. We got so good at conflict that we made it obsolete, and, in the process, eliminated the trivial solution. We can't walk away from problems anymore, there's nowhere to go.

Which, of course, isn't true. There are plenty of places to go, that, in the grand scheme, aren't that far away. Venus and Mars are close neighbors, and the Jovian moons of Callisto, Ganymede and Europa all may have water on them. Only, there's some major sticking points, first, you can't just walk outside. On Venus, you'd melt before you even got to the surface \(both due to the heat and sulfuric acid clouds\), and if you did manage to make it, you'd be crushed by the atmospheric pressure. On Mars and the Jovian moons you'd freeze rather quickly. Solution: wear something warm. Then there's the small problem of atmospheric composition, or lack thereof. Solution: bring it with you. Then there's the relentless solar radiation. Solution: live underground. Now do this all millions of miles from the comfortable environment you evolved to live in with only a fraction of the surface gravity you are used to. If all of that sounds stupidly difficult, it's because it is stupidly difficult. And stupidly expensive, and therefore, not going to happen.

In the Hollywood version, this is the point where our fearless main character gives an inspiring speech about how we're going to buckle down and solve our most intractable problems because, damn it, this is the only chance we've got. This isn't that kind of movie. Walking away spawned some of the greatest successes in human history - it's a trivial solution, but an effective one. We could, to be sure, buckle down and solve some problems, but that might be more akin to plugging a leak in an already overloaded dam - eventually it's going to burst. That's the cascade, waiting for something we didn't see coming to open up a crack we can't fix. And that's why we should be putting everything we have in to finding a way walk away \(to Mars\) now. The longer we wait, the more likely it is that it never happens.
