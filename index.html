      I've built things my entire life. I used to engineer live sound systems, but now I'm a
      software engineer. I'm currently interested in building highly scalable,
      machine-learning ready systems using data from Internet of Things systems and
      social feeds.

      I also tinker with computer hardware and spend my free time on the golf course or
      with the latest in sports and news.
