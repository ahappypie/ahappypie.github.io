<p>As a brand new engineer, I was asked to evaluate Scala and Akka for backend services. Along the way, I learned how to
learn new programming languages and techniques while still contributing value, and an important lesson about data.</p>
<h2>A New Language</h2>
<p>For the first-time user (let alone first-time engineer), Scala can be a daunting language. This isn&#x27;t exactly approachable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def foldLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) ⇒ B): B
</code></pre>
<p>For better or worse, a reasonable IDE will greet you with things like this when dealing with Scala collections. Lots of functions
with generic parameters that do increasingly generic things. And here is the first lesson: when in doubt, try it out. IDEs
with built in debuggers are modern magic - use them. Scala is a statically typed language - meaning when it thinks something
is wrong, it won&#x27;t compile. You can be reasonable assured that compiled Scala code is going to run <em>something</em>. So run it!
Place breakpoints! Not sure what this crazy function does? Write a quick demo and find out. Learning by doing is definitely
not the wrong way, especially in software where changes are so easy to make. After a couple of tries, you realize
<code>collection.foldLeft(0.0)(_ + _)</code> is just a <em>really</em> fancy way of saying give me the sum of this collection as a double.</p>
<h2>Behave!</h2>
<p>After a while, Scala becomes a somewhat approachable language (tip: ignore the <em>purely functional</em> stuff if you don&#x27;t need it.) -
it can be object-oriented, like Java, or it can be functional, like Python, or it can be both! Both is a bit of a stretch
sometimes, so I found it best to pick one. In this project, I took the object oriented approach, and quickly discovered I needed
something more flexible to handle HTTP requests. Enter the Akka framework and <strong>spray-can</strong>, an excellent HTTP server (edit:
from the future, spray-can is missed greatly). Akka is a message-driven Actor Framework for the JVM, inspired by Erlang, where
each object (an actor) has behaviors (actions) that are triggered by messages. For instance, if I want to write something to a database,
I might have a DbActor with a write method, triggered by a WriteMessage message.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Actors also have a lifecycle. You can take advantage of this to do things like setup and teardown database connections
in a more dynamic fashion than a traditional constructor. Akka happens to be terrifyingly efficient, and can house a truly ludicrous
number of actors in a single machine. Seriously - they only take up a few hundred bytes of memory each. So throwing lots of messages around
and having actors spin up and down in response is no big deal. This allows you to encapsulate units of work into small, purpose built actors.</p>
<p>Putting together behavior and lifecycle is more than just an efficient programming paradigm, it also helps frame how you think about your
system. As my first real project, I had never dealt with HTTP requests or databases before. But once I realized what Akka was providing me,
I began to understand everything as a set of behaviors, and the pieces began to fall into place. And this was the second lesson - use your tools.
It&#x27;s somewhat trivial, but software tools are no different than physical tools. Akka is just a hammer. A very, very special hammer, that
if you swing in a particular way, does things that other hammers do not.</p>
<h2>Missing in Action</h2>
<p>After you do all the programming, and all the testing, it&#x27;s time for production. In this project, production was gathering
information from webhooks sent by Mailgun, triggered by email marketing campaigns. The goal was simple - understand how
people are interacting with the messaging we are sending out into the world. So, up goes the server, and out go the emails.
The next morning, you wake up, check the database, and there&#x27;s...not much. 100 events, give or take. Given you just sent
thousands or tens of thousands of emails, that doesn&#x27;t seem right. According to Mailgun&#x27;s documentation, you should be getting events
for opens, clicks, etc. You&#x27;re a first time engineer, so maybe there&#x27;s a mistake, right? There&#x27;s definitely a mistake. You apologize,
&quot;my fault, it&#x27;ll be fixed by the end of the day.&quot; More testing, more programming. Doesn&#x27;t seem like anything is wrong. Ask your boss, maybe
it&#x27;s related to the infrastructure? Nope, everything looks good on our end. So what&#x27;s the problem? Spam. Your email is spam.
Of course it&#x27;s spam, you&#x27;re on a brand new domain sending tens of thousands of emails. The few events you are getting back are the people
unfortunate enough to have an email without a decent spam filter. And this is the final lesson from this project - lack of data is still data,
specifically, it&#x27;s the absence of it. That&#x27;s still a valid piece of analysis, even if it&#x27;s not the one anyone wants to hear. But just
like the scenarios when you have lots of data, you can still take action based on it. In this case? Make sure your emails are getting past
the spam filter.</p>
