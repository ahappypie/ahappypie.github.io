a:T637,After you do all the programming, and all the testing, it's time for production. In this project, production was gathering
information from webhooks sent by Mailgun, triggered by email marketing campaigns. The goal was simple - understand how
people are interacting with the messaging we are sending out into the world. So, up goes the server, and out go the emails.
The next morning, you wake up, check the database, and there's...not much. 100 events, give or take. Given you just sent
thousands or tens of thousands of emails, that doesn't seem right. According to Mailgun's documentation, you should be getting events
for opens, clicks, etc. You're a first time engineer, so maybe there's a mistake, right? There's definitely a mistake. You apologize,
"my fault, it'll be fixed by the end of the day." More testing, more programming. Doesn't seem like anything is wrong. Ask your boss, maybe
it's related to the infrastructure? Nope, everything looks good on our end. So what's the problem? Spam. Your email is spam.
Of course it's spam, you're on a brand new domain sending tens of thousands of emails. The few events you are getting back are the people
unfortunate enough to have an email without a decent spam filter. And this is the final lesson from this project - lack of data is still data,
specifically, it's the absence of it. That's still a valid piece of analysis, even if it's not the one anyone wants to hear. But just
like the scenarios when you have lots of data, you can still take action based on it. In this case? Make sure your emails are getting past
the spam filter.8:["$","section",null,{"children":[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"headline\":\"Mailgun Automated Response System\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-09-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"dateModified\":\"2014-09-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"description\":\"My introduction to reactive systems.\",\"image\":\"https://ahappypie.github.io/og?title=Mailgun Automated Response System\",\"url\":\"https://ahappypie.github.io/projects/mailgun-webhook\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Brian Bagdasarian\"}}"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-bold text-2xl tracking-tighter max-w-[650px]","children":["$","$L9",null,{"children":"Mailgun Automated Response System"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex justify-between items-center mt-2 mb-8 text-sm max-w-[650px]","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400","children":"September 6, 2014"}]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"prose prose-quoteless prose-neutral dark:prose-invert","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"Background"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"As a brand new engineer, I was asked to evaluate Scala and Akka for backend services.
